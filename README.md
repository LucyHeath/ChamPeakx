## Description
Champeakx is a website which provides information about the best mountaineering in Chamonix. Mountaineers can create an account which  enables them to post reviews and images of their experiences of the routes listed on the site. This information can be viewed by both registered and non-registered users in the community and serves as a useful respository for route beta for subsequent mountaineering trips. 

## Deployment Link
The project was deployed using Heroku and is available [here](http://bit.ly/Champeakx).

## Timeframe
This was the final project built solo over 7 days for the General Assembly Engineering Immersive Course. 

## Brief
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Planning

### Wireframe

 I used [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to sketch out how the pages of the site would look and flow. I planned how to execute the project on [Trello](https://trello.com), creating a TODO list and diving work up into sections, with mini targets over the course of the project. 

## Database Relationships

I used [Quick Database Diagrams](https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com)
